# This function plots urchin mass vs diameter for whichever species you specify.

# Line 1: Creating a function, calling it plotMvsD. Call the function argument 
# "spp.name" because later, when you use the function, you will type in 
# "plotMvsD (the species name you are interested in). 
# Line 2: plot mass as a function of diameter using data from the dataframe called

# CubicLine
# This function draws a cubic line (y = c*x^3) for any given x values.

#Line 1: Creating a function, assigning it the name "CubicLine". Setting some defaults.
# By default, we are setting the scaling coefficient (c in the above equation) to 1, 
# and considering x values between 0 and 100. The ... allows us to modify and add more 
# graphical parameters later without telling R right now what they will be.

#Line 2: The function will be a modification of the already-existent "lines" function, 
# which takes given coordinates and joins the points on a plot with lines. In this case,
# we are telling R to use the specified x.vals as the x values, and the scaling coefficient 
# (coeff) multiplied by the cubed x.vals as the y values to use as coordinates, and 
# join all these points with line segments. 

# Q3. Write a function to plot urchin mass against urchin diameter, 
# overlay points corresponding to gonad mass versus diameter in a contrasting colour, 
# and finally overlay a scaled cubic curve at an arbitrary scaling coefficient 
# (again, in a contrasting colour). 
# Use the function to print the resulting plot side-by-side for the three species. 
# Use your function's handy cubic-curve-plotting ability to find values of the 
# scaling coefficients that most closely (by eye) correspond to each speciesâ€™ 
# gonad mass-to-diameter relationship. 
# Note that there are individuals for which total mass,but not gonad mass,
# was recorded, and vice versa. Hand in your code and plot.

# Q5. Calculate the mean urchin mass for each of the three species in our dataset,
# using a for loop containing a conditional statement, rather than the tapply 
# function. You'll need to take different actions, depending on the species and
# whether the mass value is NA or not. There are many ways to do this, but weâ€™re 
# going to do it without using built-in functions in the for loop. Set up variables 
# to store the number of mass records and the total of those mass measures for each 
# species, then loop over the vector c(1:nrow(data)), adding to your counter and 
# total variables. Submit commented R code and your mean-mass results.

# Start by creating a vector of sum of masses (), and a vector for the length of the vector.

# the previous value for Sf.tot (which also starts at 0), and add 1. This works as a counter. For
# each iteration, it will add "1". Finally, for Sf.mean, divide the value of vector Sf.sum by 
# Sf.tot. If the species in the row of the ith iteration is S. purpuratus, do the same, but with 
# vectors Sp.sum, Sp.tot, and Sp.mean. If it's L. pictus, do the same with vectors Lp.sum,
