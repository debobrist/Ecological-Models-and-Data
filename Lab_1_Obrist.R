#Q2: In your own words, describe what the plotMvsD and CubicLine functions do. 
# As part of explanation, submit commented R code that explains the function 
# definition and function call line-by-line

plotMvsD <- function (spp.name) {
  plot(mass ~ diam, data = data[data$species == spp.name, ])
}

# This function plots urchin mass vs diameter for whichever species you specify.

# Line 1: Creating a function, calling it plotMvsD. Call the function argument 
# "spp.name" because later, when you use the function, you will type in 
# "plotMvsD (the species name you are interested in). 
# Line 2: plot mass as a function of diameter using data from the dataframe called
# data, subsetting from rows containing the species name given.

CubicLine = function (coeff = 1, x.vals = c(0:100), ...) {
  lines (x.vals, coeff*x.vals^3, ...)
}

# CubicLine
# This function draws a cubic line (y = c*x^3) for any given x values.

#Line 1: Creating a function, assigning it the name "CubicLine". Setting some defaults.
# By default, we are setting the scaling coefficient (c in the above equation) to 1, 
# and considering x values between 0 and 100. The ... allows us to modify and add more 
# graphical parameters later without telling R right now what they will be.

#Line 2: The function will be a modification of the already-existent "lines" function, 
# which takes given coordinates and joins the points on a plot with lines. In this case,
# we are telling R to use the specified x.vals as the x values, and the scaling coefficient 
# (coeff) multiplied by the cubed x.vals as the y values to use as coordinates, and 
# join all these points with line segments. 

# Q3. Write a function to plot urchin mass against urchin diameter, 
# overlay points corresponding to gonad mass versus diameter in a contrasting colour, 
# and finally overlay a scaled cubic curve at an arbitrary scaling coefficient 
# (again, in a contrasting colour). 
# Use the function to print the resulting plot side-by-side for the three species. 
# Use your function's handy cubic-curve-plotting ability to find values of the 
# scaling coefficients that most closely (by eye) correspond to each speciesâ€™ 
# gonad mass-to-diameter relationship. 
# Note that there are individuals for which total mass,but not gonad mass,
# was recorded, and vice versa. Hand in your code and plot.
